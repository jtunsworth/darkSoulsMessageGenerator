# Dark Souls Message Generator #
For this project I will create a message generator based upon the *From Software* **Dark Souls** game series. 
## How it will work ##
The generator will take in 5 different arrays. Each with 10 pieces of data. The first being an array of names for the user and the others will consist of the message content. A random value from each array will then be concatinated together to form the random message.
## Array ideas ##
#### Names ####
Chosen One, Chosen Undead, Unkindled One, Cursed Undead, Hollowed One, Dear Hunter, Afflicted One, Feeble Paleblood, Ashen One, Good Messenger.
### Messages to be broken up into arrays ###

Below is a list of the message contents. Longer passages broken up with |. 
1. /Once, the Lord of Light banished Dark, and all that stemmed from humanity. And Men assumed a fleeting form. /| /These are the roots of our world. Men are props on the stage of life, and no matter how tender, how exquisite...A lie will remain a lie!/
2. /I may be small, but I will die a colossus./
3. /Choose thy fate. Seize it with thine own hands. All the more, should thy fate entail such foul betrayal./
4. /We shall never be forgotten. We knights fought valiantly, but for every one of them, we lost three score of our own./ | /Exhiliration, pride, hatred, rage...The world teased out our dearest emotions. Thou will understand, one day./ | /At thy twilight, old thoughts return, in waves of great nostalgia./
5. / Seek strength, the rest will follow./
6. /This land is peaceful, its inhabitants kind./
7. /Brother, unyielding sword. Rise, if you would...For that is our curse/.
8. /Lead thy life as thou seest fit./
9. /Goodbye now. Stay safe friend. Don't you dare go Hollow./
10. /Many monarchs have come and gone. One drowned in poison, another succumbed to flame. Still another slumbers in a realm of ice./ | Not one of them stood here, as you do now. You, conqueror of adversities
11. /Our futures are murky. Let's not be too friendly now./
12. /There is no path. Beyond the scope of Light. Beyond the reach of Dark. What could possibly await us? And yet we seek it, insatiably. Such is our fate./
13. /Men develop the most perculiar fascinations. Sometimes their fascinations seem to take control. Till there's very little man left./
14. / Strong I am, forge I can./
15. /Let the sun shine upon this Lord of Cinder./
16. /You've got a heart of gold. Don't let them take it from you./
17. /Nameless, accursed Undead, unfit even to be cinder. And so it is, that ash seeketh embers./
18. /The Sun is a wonderous body, like a magnificent father. What seeketh thee?/
19. /The world will fall. The fire will fade, and the souls of old will reemrge. With Dark unshackled, a curse will be upon us. And men will take their true shape./
20. /Lord of Cinder. Not for virtue, but for might. Touch the darkness inside me./
21. Cross the gaps between worlds and engage in jolly cooperation. Mayest thou thine peace discover.
22. /Touch the darkness inside me./
23. /The First Flame quickly fades. Darkness will shortly settle. But one day, tiny flames will dance across the darkness. Like embers, linked by lords past./
24. /Anything that has a beginning also has an end. No flame, however brilliant, does not one day splutter and fade. But then, from the ashes, the flame reignites, and a new knigdom is born, sporting a new face./ | /It is all a curse, and it is your cursed flesh that will inherit the flame./
25. /For the curse of life is the curse of want. And so do you peer into the fog. In hope of answers./
26. /Praise the Sun./
27. /But even so, one day the flames will fade, and only Dark will remain. And even a legend such as thineself can do nothing to stop that./
28. My blade may break, my arrows fall wide, but my will shall never be broken. Those who live by the sword will die by it, and I won't go down without drawing mine.
29. /Death is equitable, accepting. We will all one day be welcomed by her embrace./
30. /This marks the spot of our grave, but you may rest here too, if you would like./
31. /Beasts all over the shop. You'll be one of them...sooner or later./
32. /Life is a journey, and every journey eventually leads to home./
33. /One day, the flames will fade./
34. /The poor, wretched souls. Be they lord or legend, the curse shows no mercy./
35. /You were at my side all along. My true mentor, my guiding moonlight./
36. /What good is a hound without hares to hunt?/
37. /Honourable soverign, take your throne. And do great things, if it please./
38. /Take nourishment from these sovereignless souls./
39. /Fire came to be, and with it, disparity. Heat and cold, life and death, light and dark./ | /Dark was seen as a curse. Shadow is not cast, but born of fire. And, the brighter the flame, the deeper the shadow./ | /Inherit fire and harness the dark. Such is the calling of a true leader./ 
40. /Let strength be granted, so the world might be mended./
41. /Acts of goodness are not always wise, and acts of evil are not always foolish, but regardless, we shall always strive to be good./
42. /Here we stand, feet planted in the earth, but might the cosmos be very near us, only just above our heads?/
43. /We are born of the blood, made men by the blood. Our eyes are yet to open...Fear the old blood./
44. /I should think you still have dreams, well next time you dream...give some thought, to the hunt./
45. /The manifestation of madness comes from a mind teetering on the very brink, but has a sane mind produced anything of true significance?/
46. /When the frail of heart join the fray, the hunter becomes the hunted./
47. /Plant eyes on our brains, to clense our beastly idiocy!/ | /Blasphemous murderers, blood-crazed fiends, atonement for the wrteches./ | /By the wrath of the mother, mercy for the poor child...Mercy, oh please./
48. /The red moon hangs low and beasts rule the streets. Are we left with no other choice, than to burn it all to cinders./
49. /Curse the fiends, their children too, and their children forever true. A call to the bloodless wherever they be./
50. /Do you know why we are drawn to the nightmare? Because it sprouted from our very misdeeds/ | /Things that some would prefer kept secret. A pitiful tale of petty arrogance. High time someone exposed the whole charade./
