# Dark Souls Message Generator #
For this project I will create a message generator based upon the *From Software* **Dark Souls** game series. 
## How it will work ##
The generator will take in 5 different arrays. Each with 10 pieces of data. The first being an array of names for the user and the others will consist of the message content. A random value from each array will then be concatinated together to form the random message.
## Array ideas ##
#### Names ####
Chosen One, Chosen Undead, Unkindled One, Cursed Undead, Hollowed One, Dear Hunter, Afflicted One, Feeble Paleblood, Ashen One, Good Messenger.
### Messages to be broken up into arrays ###

Below is a list of the message contents. Longer passages broken up with |. 
1. Once, the Lord of Light banished Dark, and all that stemmed from humanity. And Men assumed a fleeting form. | These are the roots of our world. Men are props on the stage of life, and no matter how tender, how exquisite...A lie will remain a lie!
2. I may be small, but I will die a colossus.
3. Choose thy fate. Seize it with thine own hands. All the more, should thy fate entail such foul betrayal.
4. We shall never be forgotten. We knights fought valiantly, but for every one of them, we lost three score of our own. | Exhiliration, pride, hatred, rage...The world teased out our dearest emotions. Thou will understand, one day. | At thy twilight, old thoughts return, in waves of great nostalgia.
5. Seek strength, the rest will follow.
6. This land is peaceful, its inhabitants kind.
7. Brother, unyielding sword. Rise, if you would...For that is our curse.
8. Lead thy life as thou seest fit.
9. Goodbye now. Stay safe friend. Don't you dare go Hollow.
10. Many monarchs have come and gone. One drowned in poison, another succumbed to flame. Still another slumbers in a realm of ice. | Not one of them stood here, as you do now. You, conqueror of adversities
11. Our futures are murky. Let's not be too friendly now.
12. There is no path. Beyond the scope of Light. Beyond the reach of Dark. What could possibly await us? And yet we seek it, insatiably. Such is our fate.
13. Men develop the most perculiar fascinations. Sometimes their fascinations seem to take control. Till there's very little man left.
14. Strong I am, forge I can.
15. Let the sun shine upon this Lord of Cinder.
16. You've got a heart of gold. Don't let them take it from you.
17. Nameless, accursed Undead, unfit even to be cinder. And so it is, that ash seeketh embers,
18. The Sun is a wonderous body, like a magnificent father. What seeketh thee?
19. The world will fall. The fire will fade, and the souls of old will reemrge. With Dark unshackled, a curse will be upon us. And men will take their true shape.
20. Lord of Cinder. Not for virtue, but for might.
21. Cross the gaps between worlds and engage in jolly cooperation. Mayest thou thine peace discover.
22. Touch the darkness inside me.
23. The First Flame quickly fades. Darkness will shortly settle. But one day, tiny flames will dance across the darkness. Like embers, linked by lords past.
24. Anything that has a beginning also has an end. No flame, however brilliant, does not one day splutter and fade. But then, from the ashes, the flame reignites, and a new knigdom is born, sporting a new face. | It is all a curse, and it is your cursed flesh that will inherit the flame.
25. For the curse of life is the curse of want. And so do you peer into the fog. In hope of answers.
26. Praise the Sun.
27. But even so, one day the flames will fade, and only Dark will remain. And even a legend such as thineself can do nothing to stop that.
28. My blade may break, my arrows fall wide, but my will shall never be broken. | Those who live by the sword will die by it, and I won't go down without drawing mine.
29. Death is equitable, accepting. We will all one day be welcomed by her embrace.
30. This marks the spot of our grave, but you may rest here too, if you would like.
31. Beasts all over the shop. You'll be one of them...sooner or later.
32. Life is a journey, and every journey eventually leads to home.
33. One day, the flames will fade.
34. The poor, wretched souls. Be they lord or legend, the curse shows no mercy.
35. You were at my side all along. My true mentor, my guiding moonlight.
36. What good is a hound without hares to hunt?
37. Honourable soverign, take your throne. And do great things, if it please.
38. Take nourishment from these sovereignless souls.
39. Fire came to be, and with it, disparity. Heat and cold, life and death, light and dark. | Dark was seen as a curse. Shadow is not cast, but born of fire. And, the brighter the flame, the deeper the shadow. | Inherit fire and harness the dark. Such is the calling of a true leader. 
40. Let strength me granted, so the world might be mended.
