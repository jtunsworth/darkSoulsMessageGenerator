The fire will fade, and the souls of old will reemrge. With Dark unshackled, a curse will be upon us. And men will take their true shape.', 'Anything that has a beginning also has an end. No flame, however brilliant, does not one day splutter and fade. But then, from the ashes, the flame reignites, and a new knigdom is born, sporting a new face.', 'For the curse of life is the curse of want. And so do you peer into the fog.

Like embers, linked by lords past.', 'Here we stand, feet planted in the earth, but might the cosmos be very near us, only just above our heads?', 'Curse the fiends, their children too, and their children forever true.
